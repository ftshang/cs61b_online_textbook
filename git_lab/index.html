    <h2 id="version-control-systems">A. Intro to Version Control Systems</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Version control systems are tools to keep track of changes to files over time. Version control allows you to
            view or revert back to previous iterations of files. Some aspects of
            version control are actually built into commonly used applications. Think of the <span
                class="code">undo</span> command or how you can see the revision history of a Google document.
        </p>

        <p>In the context of coding, version control systems can track the history of code revisions, from the current
            state of the code all the way back until it was first tracked.
            This allows users to reference older versions of their work and share code changes with other people, like
            fellow developers.
        </p>

        <p>Version control has become a backbone of software development and collaboration in industry. In this class,
            we will be using <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.
            Git has excellent <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc" target="_blank">documentation</a> so we highly encourage
            those who are interested to read more about what will be summarized in the rest of this guide.

    <h3>Intro to Git</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control" target="_blank">distributed
                version control system</a> as opposed to a centralized version control system. This means that every
            developer's computer stores the entire history (including all old versions) of the entire project!
            This is rather unlike toos like Dropbox, where old versions are stored on a remote server owned by someone
            else.
            We call the entire history of an entire project a "repository". The fact that the repository is stored
            locally
            leads to our ability to use Git locally on our computers, even without an internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lab computers already have Git installed on the command line, and the <a
                href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab01/" target="_blank">lab01 setup</a> guide explains
            how to install git on your own computer. In addition to the text based interface that we'll be learning to
            use in this guide, there is also a <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" target="_blank">Git GUI
                (Graphical User Interface)</a>. We will not officially support usage of the graphical GUI.
