                href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/git/" target="_blank">Using Git</a> guide from UC

    <div>
        <p>Version control systems are tools to keep track of changes to files over time. Version control allows you to
            view or revert back to previous iterations of files. Some aspects of
            version control are actually built into commonly used applications. Think of the <span
                class="code">undo</span> command or how you can see the revision history of a Google document.
        </p>

        <p>In the context of coding, version control systems can track the history of code revisions, from the current
            state of the code all the way back until it was first tracked.
            This allows users to reference older versions of their work and share code changes with other people, like
            fellow developers.
        </p>

        <p>Version control has bcome a backbone of software development and collaboration in industry. In this class, we
            will be using <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.
            Git has excellent <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc" target="_blank">documentation</a> so we highly encourage
            those who are interested to read more about what will be summarized in the rest of this guide.
